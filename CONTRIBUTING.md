# Contributing to The Fastest Mouse Clicker for Windows

## Coding Style

First and most generic rule: **just look around**.

You can use any appropriate code style (camelCase, names_with_underscores, etc.). Just do not start variable names with Capital letter.

## Testing

Since auto-clicker is a specific app, one could not cover all the logic by unit tests, so they are optional. But please **always** test your proposed patches manually!
