# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to versions: **the latest** (currently v2.6.2.0, but growing in time) and **the classic** (fixed in time v2.1.6.0).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.**
This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it by email: **mashanovedad@gmail.com**.

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, vulnerabilities will be disclosed in a best effort base.
