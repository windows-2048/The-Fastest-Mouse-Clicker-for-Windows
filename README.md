### Brief list of main features

* The world's best click rate up to 100 000 clicks per second, increased by 10 times comparing with the predecessor application "Fast Mouse Clicker". The latest version with fixed performance issue is 100 times faster!

* Utilizes batch-array feature of <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput" target="_blank">SendInput()</a></code> and manipulates with <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep" target="_blank">Sleep()</a></code> to reach the ultimate possible performance of mouse clicks on Windows.

* The Left, Middle, and Right mouse buttons are supported, they can be triggered for clicking by a key on the keyboard in a press or toggle mode.

* Arbitrary keyboard key can be selected to trigger the clicking process. Furthermore, an another mouse button can play a role of a trigger key.

* Different independent trigger keys to begin/end the clicking in toggle mode.

* The program works fine even if it is minimized and also it operates on an arbitrary desktop area. The program can stop to click automatically, if a certain number of clicks is given by end-user.

* By default, the project executables will use some 25% of CPU resources and 100Kb/day of Internet resources when a computer is idling.
You may switch between executables that use PC resources and executables that don't use Pc resources by reinstalling the software.
More information on Windows installers that use or don't use PC resources is [here](https://github.com/windows-2048/The-Fastest-Mouse-Clicker-for-Windows/blob/master/InnoSetupDownloader/README.md).

* Command line has been supported: TheFastestMouseClicker.exe -c <clicks per second> -t <trigger key> -s <stop at> -m <trigger key mode> -b <mouse button to click>, where <trigger key mode> can be 'press' or'toggle' and <mouse button to click> can be 'left', 'middle', or 'right'. One may specify any part of arguments; unspecified or unrecognized values will be treated as defaults (see them by running the app and pressing 'Reset to defaults' button.

* Button "Batch folder" has been added to open a directory with *.bat files quickly; it simplifies command line usage a lot.

* Fractional values for clicks/s parameter are supported. For example, 0.5 clicks/s equals to 1 click every 2 seconds.

* Random clicking has been implemented. Just click the "Batch folder" button and see remarks in the *.bat files reside there in order how to use command line arguments and to enable random clicking.

* This is free, open source application without ads, viruses, trojans, malware, etc. forever.
